# mod1: Dynamic Fluid simulation

Real-time water simulation program with various water emission scenarios and
complex surface collision using inverse-distance weighting interpolation.

Simulation was written in C++ with vizualization part taken by OpenGL, but was
later rewritten from scratch to happen completely on GPU.
